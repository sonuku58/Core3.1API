        <p>Our primary aim is to develop in students the qualities of integrity, honesty, trust, tolerance and compassion; to promote a spirit of enquiry; to foster a scientific temper within the bounds of humanism; to help the students become a meaningful part of their environment and to learn that courage and industry have their due reward.
